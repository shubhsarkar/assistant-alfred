# Alfred
If you're a Batman fan, then it's obvious you know who Alfred Pennyworth is! After Bruce's parents murdered in the Crime Alley, Gotham, it was Alfred who took care of young Bruce. Alfred always been a father-figure and mentor to Bruce but most important he's Bruce's butler. Bruce will go through each and everyone to save Alfred from getting hurt.

It's obvious my program can't replicate Alfred exactly, but it can perform certain assistant tasks.

## Motive to do this program?
Well I'm a huge DC fan and obviously a Batman fanboy. So I tried to do something for timepass. This is just an initial model of an assistant. I'll keep on updating the program to make it perform better.

## Additional header files
There are additional header file that you must install:
- pyttsx3
- speech_recognition
- pyaudio
- wikipedia
- pywhatkit

Google search each of them to see how to install them. Make sure you're using python 3.7 or above and pip 18. This is just for being sure that you won't get any error.

## How to use
Run the program:
- to open any website, say "open" and name of the site. For eg: "open github"
- to search anything, say "search", then what you want to search, then "google". For eg: "search github google"
- to play any youtube video, say "play", then the video name, then "youtube". For eg: "play in the end youtube"
- to send an email, say "send an email" and then the person name, then the content of the email. For eg: "send an email", then "bruce", then "Hello Master Bruce"
